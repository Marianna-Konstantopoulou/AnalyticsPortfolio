# Telemarketing Success Predictor

### Description of the Problem
This project focuses on the effectiveness of telemarketing efforts aimed at selling long-term bank deposits. During each campaign, agents reach out to potential customers through outbound calls or, if customers contact the bank for other reasons, they are encouraged to subscribe to the product during those inbound interactions. The result is a binary outcome variable that indicates whether the interaction was successful (subscription) or unsuccessful (no subscription).

### Data Overview
The dataset comprises real-world data collected from a retail bank between May 2008 and June 2010, encompassing approximately 40,000 phone interactions. Frequently, multiple contacts with the same client were necessary to determine whether they would subscribe to the bank's term deposit product.

### Aim of the Project
The primary aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies whether a client is likely to purchase the long-term deposit based on the available data. 

### Background Information
The dataset includes various variables related to the bank clients, such as:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, education, marital status, and job type.
- **Financial Status**: Information regarding housing loans and personal loans.
- **Contact Details**: Type of communication and frequency of contact during current or previous campaigns.
- **Economic Indicators**: Employment variation rate, consumer price index, consumer confidence index, and the number of employees.

Additionally, the project aims to explore the clustering of clients based on the aforementioned variables, providing insights into distinct customer segments and their characteristics.
