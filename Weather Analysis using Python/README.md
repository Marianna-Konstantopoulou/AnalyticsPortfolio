# Exploring the Weather in Athens

In this assignment, you will explore the weather in Athens over a period of more than 50 years.

## Questions

### Q1: Obtain the Data
You will work with data covering the period from 1955 to 2020. The data will be obtained from two sources:

1. **NOAA Data**: Data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information ([NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)). Focus on the Hellinikon weather station for average daily temperature and precipitation.
2. **Alternative Dataset**: Use an alternative dataset from [Hellenic Data Service](https://data.hellenicdataservice.gr/dataset/66e1c19a-7b0e-456f-b465-b301a1130e3f) for the period 2010-2019 to fill in any missing data.

**Explore the completeness of the data. What data are missing?**

### Q2: Deviation of Summer Temperatures
Using a baseline of 1974-1999, create a graph similar to the one in the [Hellenic National Meteorological Service report](http://www.hnms.gr/emy/en/pdf/2020_GRsignificantEVENT_en.pdf) on mean summer temperature deviation. Interpret the figure.

### Q3: Evolution of Daily Temperatures
Calculate the average temperature for each year (1955-2020) and create a plot showing daily temperatures with a 30-day rolling average. Overlay the average daily temperature for the baseline period (1974-1999). Interpret the figure.

### Q4: Extreme Temperature Events
Count the number of extreme heat events (10% above the baseline) per year and create a graph showing the percentage of extreme events. Interpret the graph.

### Q5: Precipitation
Analyze yearly rainfall and the number of rainy days. Calculate the ratio of rainfall to rainy days and create a plot with a 10-year rolling average. Interpret the plot.

## Submission Instructions
Submit a Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis. Ensure it runs correctly on any computer and is clear enough for others to understand.

## Honor Code
This is an individual assignment. You may seek help online for general questions but not for direct solutions to the assignment. Discuss with fellow students for clarity but do not share answers.
